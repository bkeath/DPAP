Dynamic Port Authentication Protocol
This project was part of a concept I was working on in college regarding controling firewall ports via Web Services or calls directly to Firewall API's. The idea is instead of blindly creating static firewall rules, you would open firewall rules programatically only when you need access to that service. The idea is to eventually develop a standard, hence the word protocol being in the name, regardless of it being a bit of a misnomber.
